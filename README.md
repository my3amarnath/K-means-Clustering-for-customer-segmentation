## Introduction to Data set

Imagine that you have a customer dataset, and you need to apply customer segmentation on this historical data. Customer segmentation is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources. For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. A business task is to retain those customers. Another group might include customers from non-profit organizations and so on.
